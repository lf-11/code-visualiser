# Improving js parser for workflows (2025-09-16 10:51Z)

_**User (2025-09-16 07:02Z)**_

I have a project to parse code files and extract code elements, like functions, classes etc. I was wondering though, what are the relevant code elements for java script, especially if I am programming a js html frontend, fastapi backend app? I think my parser currently does not identify event listeners individually, for example, but they are important no? My goal is to find workflows in my code, i.e. when I press a button, what gets executed. Then a workflow is a group of code pieces relevant to this. I am an amateur programmer, so I only try to grasp this. For example, in my index.html there is this button, in app.js it is defined as a dom element, an event listener is added  and then parse Project is exectued upon click. This then calls this endpoint "/api/projects/parse"  which then calls the parsers, etc. etc. All the snippets I attached you to this message should make up one workflow. This is so I can better understand the workings of complex projects. Now for this my js parser would need to be able to find the event listener, and the parse button definition. Functions it can already identify fine. Also child parent hierarchies work, if the entire app.js is inside something like the DOMContentLoaded event listener. But how can I improve my parser so it also gets the dom element definitions as single elements, and the event listeners as well? Because we need them to get the js function then, etc. etc.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Defining Parser Goals**

I'm focusing on how to refine the Javascript parser to pinpoint elements crucial for frontend web app workflows. Currently, the core objective is understanding the code and identifying its significant components. I'm strategizing about the best ways to approach this complex task, looking at various potential avenues.


**Refining Extraction Strategy**

I'm now trying to extract specific details like DOM element definitions and event listener attachments. I'm going through the provided code samples, especially from `index.html` and `static/app.js`, to test my approach. I'm starting with simpler parsing methods to gather the data and refine them as needed.


**Assessing Current Capabilities**

I'm now digging into the actual code of `parsers/js_parser.py`. I'm observing it uses `tree-sitter`, which is a good start. I see the code already has queries for event listeners, which is curious, given the user's issue. I'm focusing on the event listener query, specifically the different sub-queries it uses.


**Investigating Existing Queries**

I'm now analyzing the event listener query in `js_parser.py`, specifically how it extracts information and associates it with function elements. It appears the current approach adds metadata to the handler function instead of creating a dedicated "event listener" element. I'm looking at how the parser identifies `document.getElementById` calls within variable declarations, which are used for DOM element definitions.


**Defining Needed Enhancements**

I'm now focusing on how to approach the user's request of creating "single elements" for DOM definitions and event listeners, and how to integrate those with the existing parser workflow. The goal is to trace the chain of events. I'm also looking at the information currently present in the parser, which I may be able to leverage.


**Planning Refinements**

I'm solidifying my understanding of the existing parser and how it processes code, particularly the Javascript files. The plan is to create new element types: `dom_element_definition` to represent the DOM element, and `event_listener` to represent event connections, like the user desires. I will need to change the queries to identify these new entities.


**Conceptualizing the Changes**

I'm solidifying my understanding of the best approach. I'm thinking through the practical changes needed to produce separate elements for both DOM definitions and event listeners, as requested. I need to consider where to add new passes in the parser and how to construct the output structure.


**Decomposing User Request**

I'm now meticulously dissecting the user's needs, especially regarding DOM element extraction and event listener handling. I've identified the critical elements for workflow tracing, including the DOM definitions, event listeners, and API calls. The plan involves augmenting the current Javascript parser to provide individual elements for DOM definitions and event listeners, enhancing the clarity of the frontend to backend interaction flow.


**Evaluating Workflow Enhancements**

I'm now developing a plan to create `dom_element_definition` and `event_listener` elements in the Javascript parser. I am focusing on modifying the existing passes for this. My approach involves a new pass for DOM element extraction and amending the existing event listener processing.


**Defining Planned Improvements**

I'm preparing to implement the user's request by adding two new element types to the parser: `dom_element_definition` and `event_listener`. I'll make modifications in `parsers/js_parser.py` to produce these elements. I have a clear picture of the required modifications and am ready to proceed.


**Reviewing Implementation Strategy**

I'm now reviewing my implementation plan in detail, focusing on the order of passes and how new elements will integrate into the existing structure. I need to ensure that the addition of `dom_element_definition` and `event_listener` elements maintains the integrity of the code's hierarchical representation. Specifically, the logic for linking elements, such as DOM definitions to event listeners and both to their respective handlers, needs to be precisely defined.


**Outlining Implementation Steps**

I'm now constructing a detailed plan to tackle the user's requirement of adding `dom_element_definition` and `event_listener` elements. My focus is on creating these elements and linking them appropriately. I'm also considering the need to maintain compatibility with the existing hierarchical structure of the parser, to ensure that parent-child relationships are preserved.


**Formulating Implementation Strategy**

I'm now organizing my implementation, which involves adding new passes to the JavaScript parser. I'm ready to refactor the code to integrate `dom_element_definition` and `event_listener` elements and address the user's core request. The key lies in carefully constructing the queries and integrating the results into the hierarchy.


**Outlining the Approach**

I'm now prepared to detail the planned workflow modifications to integrate the desired new element types, focusing on clear, maintainable code changes. I am ready to add a new pass that specifically addresses DOM definitions and event listeners. I will also ensure that existing functionalities are not affected.


**Implementing New Element Types**

I'm now building the code needed to introduce `dom_element_definition` and `event_listener` elements within the JavaScript parser. The plan involves integrating a new pass specifically tailored for extracting and handling DOM elements and modifying the existing event listener pass. The objective is to align the parser's behavior to match the user's requirements.

Of course! I'd be happy to help you improve your Javascript parser. It's a great goal to want to visualize and understand code workflows, and you've correctly identified the key components needed to trace an action from a button click on your frontend all the way to a backend API call.

You're right, to properly trace the workflow you described (`button click` -> `event listener` -> `handler function` -> `API call`), your parser needs to identify not just functions, but also two other critical pieces:
1.  **DOM Element Definitions**: How the JavaScript code gets a reference to an element in the HTML, like your `parse-project-btn`.
2.  **Event Listeners**: The code that connects a user action (like a 'click') on a DOM element to a specific JavaScript function.

Currently, your parser is grouping these into larger, more generic code blocks. I'll modify `parsers/js_parser.py` to recognize these as distinct, individual elements. This will give you a much clearer and more detailed picture of your application's logic.

Here is the plan:
1.  I will introduce a new parsing step specifically to find DOM element definitions (like `document.getElementById(...)`) and classify them as `dom_element_definition` elements.
2.  I will then adjust the existing event listener detection logic to create explicit `event_listener` elements, rather than just adding metadata to the handler functions.

Let's start by modifying `parsers/js_parser.py`. I'll add the necessary logic to extract these new element types.

```python:parsers/js_parser.py
// ... existing code ...
    EVENT_LISTENER_QUERY = JS_LANGUAGE.query("""
    [
      (call_expression
// ... existing code ...
      )
    ]
    """)

    DOM_ELEMENT_QUERY = JS_LANGUAGE.query("""
    (call_expression
        function: (member_expression
            object: (identifier) @obj
            property: (property_identifier) @method
        )
        arguments: (arguments . (_) @selector_node)
    )
    (#match? @method "^(getElementById|querySelector|querySelectorAll)$")
    (#eq? @obj "document")
    """)

else:
    # We no longer need a global parser instance.
    pass
// ... existing code ...
        # Process any remaining nodes at the end of the file.
        create_block_from_nodes(current_block_nodes)

        # --- Pass 1.7: Find DOM element definitions ---
        for match in DOM_ELEMENT_QUERY.captures(root_node):
            call_node = match[0]
            # Ensure we don't process a node that is already part of another element
            if call_node.id in processed_node_ids:
                continue

            name = "(unassigned)"
            parent = call_node.parent
            element_node = call_node # Default to the call expression itself for position

            # Walk up to find the variable or property it's assigned to.
            if parent:
                if parent.type == 'variable_declarator':
                    name_node = parent.child_by_field_name('name')
                    if name_node: name = get_node_text(name_node)
                    element_node = parent
                elif parent.type == 'pair': # Inside an object literal
                    key_node = parent.child_by_field_name('key')

_**User (2025-09-16 07:02Z)**_

thanks. When I run this js parser on the app.js in question, I get this error

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating the TypeError**

I'm currently digging into the root cause of that `TypeError`. The traceback pinpoints the issue in `js_parser.py`, specifically with how the node captures are being handled. It seems there's a problem with subscripting a `tree_sitter.Node` object. I'm going to examine the `match` variable and its related operations to see how they might be leading to this error.


**Pinpointing the Root Cause**

I'm still untangling this `TypeError` mess. It seems I was mistaken; `match` *should* be a list of node-capture name pairs, but inside the `DOM_ELEMENT_QUERY` loop, `match` appears to be just a node itself. This means the list comprehension is trying to index a `tree_sitter.Node` object, which isn't allowed. Time to double-check how the query is being executed, and the data it's returning.


**Debugging the List Comprehension**

It seems I misread the behavior of the `captures` method, leading to the `TypeError`. The issue lies in the list comprehension within the `_parse_to_hierarchy` method. I was attempting to iterate through the `match` tuple itself, treating it as a list. This resulted in the `tree_sitter.Node` object being accessed with an index, causing the error. I'm adjusting my approach to correctly access the captured node and its associated capture name.


**Rectifying Capture Logic**

I've identified the flaw in the `DOM_ELEMENT_QUERY` loop: I was incorrectly iterating through a tuple. The `captures` method returns (node, capture_name) tuples directly. The solution is to unpack the tuple in the loop like other instances. I'll correct the list comprehension to get the selector node and its text correctly. I will be updating the query now.


**Correcting Capture Handling**

I've identified the root cause of the `TypeError`: my initial assumption about the structure returned by `captures` was wrong. It gives a flat list, not grouped by matches. I will need to adjust how the code extracts the selector node name. The issue arises because the incorrect indexing is attempting to treat a `tree_sitter.Node` object like a tuple, and that results in the error. The next step is adjusting the loop and the capture method to match the correct data format.


**Refactoring Query and Handling**

I've pinpointed the flaw: the `DOM_ELEMENT_QUERY` was incorrectly parsing the results from the `captures` method. My approach incorrectly assumed a grouped structure. The current design is to extract all the captures at once, rather than grouping by call expression. I'll refactor to iterate through the main call expression nodes and run additional, specific queries to isolate the `selector_node` and method information.


**Rethinking Capture Grouping**

I'm refining my strategy, realizing the initial capture approach was flawed. The `captures` method gives a flat list, not grouped by matches, which caused the `TypeError`. I will now refactor the query and the handling of these captures to group related captures correctly, extracting the necessary data.


**Rethinking Query Structure**

I'm revisiting my approach after that `TypeError`. My previous method of directly extracting specific captures within the main loop was incorrect, as the results from `captures` are not grouped. Now, I'm working on a revised query structure, to extract a more meaningful collection of nodes and then process those. I'll be refactoring the code to use nested queries to isolate the selector information.


**Reworking the Capture Logic**

I'm reworking the approach based on the flat nature of `captures`. The error stemmed from misinterpreting its output. I'll now extract the `call_expression` first. Then, I will use sub-queries to parse the call node to isolate the object, method, and arguments, making the process more robust.


**Re-Evaluating the Capture Process**

I've identified the core issue: my misunderstanding of the `captures` method's output structure. The initial approach incorrectly assumed the captures were grouped. The existing `TypeError` directly stems from attempting to index a `tree_sitter.Node` object within the list comprehension. The current strategy is to use sub-queries to process captures, now that the root cause is confirmed.


**Rethinking Grouping Strategy**

I've had a breakthrough in understanding the capture behavior. The original error stemmed from a misunderstanding. `captures` returns a flat list, which I now realize means I must group them manually. I will revise the code to associate the various capture groups to determine the proper object, method, and arguments.


**Analyzing Capture Iteration**

I'm now focusing on the core issue: the incorrect assumption about how the captures are structured. The primary problem stemmed from misinterpreting `captures` and attempting to index node objects. This resulted in the `TypeError`. I'm rewriting the capture processing for clarity and accuracy, which will greatly simplify my logic.


**Addressing Capture Iteration**

I'm now resolving the `TypeError` by revisiting my initial capture interpretation. I was incorrectly assuming that `captures` returned a grouped structure. The revised plan involves using sub-queries and iterating directly through the main call expression nodes to extract the appropriate data.


**Addressing Capture Iteration**

I'm now focusing on the `TypeError` and its source. The issue arises from incorrectly indexing a `tree_sitter.Node` object within the initial list comprehension, `c[1]`. This happened because the `captures` method returns a flat list. I will refactor the capture handling and iterate through the main call expression nodes.


**Addressing the Core Issue**

I'm now focusing on the error, which stems from a misunderstanding of the `captures` method's output. It returns a flat list, causing issues with indexing `tree_sitter.Node` objects. I'm revising the code to use sub-queries and iterate more directly over call expressions, ensuring proper data extraction.


**Analyzing the Error's Origin**

I've revisited the failing list comprehension, realizing I was treating a tuple as though it were a collection of captures. This is leading to the `TypeError`. My next step involves rewriting the query and capture handling to correctly extract the necessary data from the capture.


**Revisiting the Query Logic**

I'm focused on refactoring the query execution, as the initial attempt's capture handling caused a `TypeError`. My current approach uses `query.matches` to correctly group the captures by match, and within the loop, I will directly access the necessary nodes and capture names, resolving the indexing problem that led to the error.

You're absolutely right to test the changes, and thank you for providing the error traceback. It's incredibly helpful. My apologies, I introduced a bug in the way I was processing the results from the tree-sitter query. The error `TypeError: 'tree_sitter.Node' object is not subscriptable` happens because I was trying to iterate over something that isn't a list.

The logic to find the DOM elements was flawed. I'll correct `parsers/js_parser.py` with a more robust method that correctly handles the query results. This new approach will be more reliable and avoids the error you encountered.

Here are the corrections for `parsers/js_parser.py`:

```python:parsers/js_parser.py

                if parent.type == 'variable_declarator':
                    name_node = parent.child_by_field_name('name')

            elements_by_node_id[element_node.id] = {
                "kind": "dom_element_definition",
                "name": name,
                "start_line": element_node.start_point[0] + 1,
                "end_line": element_node.end_point[0] + 1,
                "metadata": {"selector": selector_text, "method": method_text},
                "node": element_node,
                "children": []
            }
            # Mark its children as processed to avoid duplication
            for capture in descendant_query.captures(element_node):
                processed_node_ids.add(capture[0].id)


        # --- Pass 2: Find event listeners using a robust, multi-query approach ---
        
        # This main query just finds the parent nodes of potential listeners.
// ... existing code ...
```

I've replaced the faulty loop with one that correctly uses the `.matches()` method to group captures for each DOM element definition it finds. I also added a `@dom_call` capture to the query to get the main node for each match.

This should resolve the `TypeError` and allow the parser to correctly identify both the DOM element definitions and the event listeners as separate elements. Please try running the parser again with these changes.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating the Syntax Error**

I'm zeroing in on the user's `SyntaxError`, pinpointing its location in `parsers/js_parser.py`. The traceback directs me to line 618, where a print statement seems to be the culprit. I'm scrutinizing the code snippet now, particularly focusing on the string formatting to identify the missing closing quotation mark. I suspect this could be the cause.


**Correcting the Code**

I've identified the root cause, an unclosed parenthesis in the `print` statement on line 618 of `parsers/js_parser.py`. The user's code snippet also correctly uses string formatting. I'm adding the closing parenthesis as a fix. Additionally, I've verified that the user's recent change to `TEST_FILE_PATH` is valid.


**Fixing the Parenthesis**

I've re-examined the provided code and confirmed the `SyntaxError: unterminated string literal` arises from a missing parenthesis on line 618 in `parsers/js_parser.py`. The user's change to `TEST_FILE_PATH` is valid. I am adding the closing parenthesis now.


**Implementing the Correction**

I'm currently adding a closing parenthesis to line 618 of `parsers/js_parser.py`, which should resolve the `SyntaxError`. I also confirm the user's recent `TEST_FILE_PATH` change is valid. The updated code looks good.

You are right to point that out. My apologies, it seems a simple typo slipped through in my previous edit, causing that `SyntaxError`. It's just a missing closing parenthesis. Your change to `TEST_FILE_PATH` is perfectly correct for testing against your `app.js` file.

I'll fix the syntax error in `parsers/js_parser.py` now.

```python:parsers/js_parser.py
// ... existing code ...
        snippet = content
        if start_line is not None and end_line is not None:
            snippet = "\n".join(lines[start_line-1:end_line])
            print(f"Analyzing snippet from L{start_line}-L{end_line}:\n```javascript\n{snippet}\n```")
        else:
            print("Analyzing full file content (may be long).")

        local_parser = Parser()
// ... existing code ...
```

I've added the missing closing parenthesis to the `print` statement. Everything should run correctly now.

thanks. But it does not print out anything now. Can you make it so for each kind of ui element it tells me how many were identfied, so I can get a gist of how many it got

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing the Parsed Data**

I'm now focusing on parsing the elements from `parsers/js_parser.py`. The script's current silent operation isn't ideal. So, my next step is implementing a print statement to output a count of each parsed element, giving me visibility into the data.


**Refining Output Logic**

I've reviewed the `VERBOSE_TEST` section and suspect the silent issue might stem from either an empty `parsed_elements` list or errors occurring before it's populated. To address this, I'll insert a check at the beginning of the `__main__` block to confirm the input file's size and the initial state of `parsed_elements`, providing some preliminary insights before diving into the verbose printing. This will reveal whether any parsing is even taking place.


**Generating Element Summaries**

I'm now adding a summary count of each UI element "kind" after parsing. This will provide a concise view of the extracted data. I'll then ensure the existing verbose output, including detailed metadata, is still functional. I'm prioritizing clarity of what has been parsed for the user.


**Implementing Element Counting**

I've just added the element counting feature within the `__main__` block, right after parsing. This involves iterating through `parsed_elements`, counting by "kind," and printing a concise summary, whether elements exist or not. I've also tweaked the final count output to complement the summary. I am ready to test.


**Summarizing Element Kinds**

I've implemented the element kind summary. After parsing, I count elements by their "kind" and output the counts. The existing verbose and final check outputs remain. I tested this and verified it's functional, with a summary of all detected elements now.


**Integrating Summary and Verbose**

My plan is to embed the element kind summary directly within the `__main__` block, right after parsing. I'll also ensure the verbose output is still functional. This way I will have both a quick overview and detailed information.


**Summarizing the Output**

I'm now inserting a summary, before the verbose and final checks. I'll count and print element "kinds" after parsing, providing a quick overview before the detailed output. The verbose mode remains functional, ensuring detailed information is still available.


**Integrating the Element Counts**

I've now implemented the element kind summary directly within the `__main__` block, placing it after the parsing step. The verbose output remains functional, offering detailed insights, while the final check confirms the script's overall status. This combines overview with detail.


**Adding Summary Output**

I've added the summary to the `__main__` block, before both the verbose output and the final checks. This summary counts and displays the element "kinds" extracted. I'll make sure the verbose mode and final checks are still fully functional.


**Adding Comprehensive Summary**

I've incorporated the element kind summary right after parsing, providing a clear overview. The verbose and final checks remain active. This ensures the user gets both a quick insight into the parsed elements and the detailed metadata.


**Enhancing the Overview**

I've added a summary of the parsed element "kinds" after parsing to give an immediate overview, before the verbose and final checks. This ensures the user has both a quick understanding of what has been parsed and access to the detailed metadata.


**Incorporating the Summary**

I've now implemented the element kind summary within the `__main__` block. This provides a quick overview immediately after parsing, before the existing verbose and final check outputs. The user will have the summary and still have detailed information.

You've got it. It's frustrating when a script runs silently without giving you any feedback. You're right, seeing a summary of what was found would be much more helpful.

I'll modify the test runner in `parsers/js_parser.py` to print a summary of element kinds and their counts right after parsing. This will give you a quick overview of what the parser has identified.

Here are the changes for `parsers/js_parser.py`:

```python:parsers/js_parser.py
// ... existing code ...
        parser = JavascriptParser()
        parsed_elements = parser.parse(js_content)

        # --- Summary of Found Elements ---
        print("\n--- Parser Summary ---")
        summary = {}
        for el in parsed_elements:
            kind = el.get('kind', 'unknown')
            summary[kind] = summary.get(kind, 0) + 1
        
        if summary:
            for kind, count in sorted(summary.items()):
                print(f"Found {count} element(s) of kind '{kind}'")
        else:
            print("No elements were extracted.")
        print("----------------------")


        print(f"\nFound a total of {len(parsed_elements)} code element(s). Detailed view:")
        print("-" * 60)

        if VERBOSE_TEST:
            for i, el in enumerate(parsed_elements, 1):
// ... existing code ...
```

I've added a new summary section that counts the elements by their `kind` and prints the totals. This should give you immediate feedback on the parser's output.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Examining Parser Failure**

I'm still wrestling with the `js_parser.py` script, and the lack of output is perplexing. I'm focusing on the provided code snippet to pinpoint the issue. My analysis centers on the execution flow and potential errors within the script. I intend to test potential errors.


**Isolating the Root Cause**

I've retraced the execution path, and the missing `js_content` definition is the critical oversight. The script attempts to parse without having loaded any content. I recall now from prior turns that a `try...except` block *should* load a file. I'm focusing my efforts now on reconstructing that missing file loading section, since that seems like the only place that would populate `js_content`.


**Reconstructing File Handling**

I've reviewed the relevant code. The supplied snippet omits the vital file-reading section. The parser attempts to process `js_content` without it being populated. I'm certain I'll need to reinstate the `try...except` block that handled the file loading. I must identify and restore that missing section from the earlier file states, and ensure `js_content` is populated correctly.


**Locating the Missing Block**

I've re-examined the latest code snippet and determined the critical missing section is the file-reading part. That code, which defines `js_content`, is absent. Also, code using `js_content` is indented incorrectly. It looks like this part of the main execution flow was misplaced, causing the script to prematurely exit.


**Revising Execution Flow**

I've reviewed the user's snippet and the broader context. It seems the user's code is structured incorrectly. Specifically, the code that instantiates and calls the parser is misplaced outside the main execution block, leading to the script's premature termination. My next step is to relocate the parsing code within the `if __name__ == '__main__':` section, ensuring correct indentation, and also to reinstate the essential file reading code to define `js_content`.


**Restructuring the Code**

I've identified that the parsing code (instantiation and parse call) is outside the main execution block and the essential file reading code is missing from the `if __name__ == '__main__':` section. The code is therefore never reaching the section that uses `js_content`. I plan to correct the placement of the code and restore the file loading logic within the main execution block, which is crucial for the parser to function correctly and for output to be generated.


**Diagnosing Indentation Errors**

The user's snippet has misplaced the parsing and summary printing logic *inside* the `print_ast` function, preventing it from executing. The file-reading part is also missing, which would cause a `NameError`. The script's structure needs adjustment. I will rearrange the code to place parsing and output within the main execution block.


**Pinpointing the Structural Error**

I've determined that the parser instantiation and parsing code is now embedded *inside* the `print_ast` function definition. This, coupled with the missing file-reading, explains the lack of output. My next step is to move the parsing logic *outside* the function, and reinstate the essential file reading.


**Identifying the Core Issue**

I've pinpointed the problem: the user's parser logic and summary code are misplaced *inside* the `print_ast` function, which is never invoked. The main execution flow, which should contain parsing, is therefore never reached. This explains why only the initial "Running JS Parser" message appears.


**Refocusing on Structure**

I've determined that the key issue is the misplacement of the parsing code *inside* the `print_ast` function. This explains why the main execution flow, including parsing, never gets reached, resulting in the limited output. The original file reading part, which provides the `js_content`, is also missing. I'll now reconstruct the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block with correct structure to define `print_ast`, read the file, call the parser, and print the summary.


</details></think>

Of course. It's frustrating when you're expecting output and get silence. My apologies, it looks like in the last few edits, the main execution logic of the script got accidentally moved *inside* the `print_ast` function definition.

Because the `print_ast` function is defined but never called, the script simply prints your "Running JS Parser" message and then exits, as you observed.

I will correct the structure of the test runner in `parsers/js_parser.py` by moving the file reading, parsing, and printing logic out of the function and into the main body of the script. This will ensure it actually runs when you execute the file.

```python:parsers/js_parser.py
// ... existing code ...
    def print_ast(content, start_line=None, end_line=None):
        """Prints the AST for a specific portion of the code for debugging."""

        lines = content.splitlines()
        snippet = content
        if start_line is not None and end_line is not None:

        print(f"\n[!] Test file not found at '{TEST_FILE_PATH}'.")
        print("    Please update the TEST_FILE_PATH variable in this script.")
        sys.exit(1)

    print(f"\n--- Parsing Test File: {os.path.basename(TEST_FILE_PATH)} ---")

    try:
        with open(TEST_FILE_PATH, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            js_content = f.read()

        if not Parser:
            print("\n[!] tree-sitter libraries not installed. Cannot run test.")

        for el in parsed_elements:
            kind = el.get('kind', 'unknown')
            summary[kind] = summary.get(kind, 0) + 1

        if file_nonempty and has_elements and has_metadata:

        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc(file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
```

I've restored the correct structure to the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, including the original file reading and error handling logic, and I also restored the original `print_ast` function so it can be used for debugging again. This should now produce the summary output you were expecting.

_**User (2025-09-16 07:02Z)**_

thanks but now this. Please look at the app.js. As is good practice I was told, all is wrapped into a evenlistener. But this cannot be the only element! we have to ignore this or treat like the element of biggest hierarchy, then find elements inside it, according to our logic. Currrently our logic is deceived by this. Common please

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing the Parsing Flaw**

I'm zeroing in on the parser's misinterpretation. It's currently lumping the whole `app.js` file, locked inside that `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper, into one giant "statement." This is a critical hurdle that needs immediate attention for accurate code breakdown.


**Unpacking the Root Issue**

I'm digging deeper into the core problem now. The parser correctly finds named functions, but it's the anonymous arrow function within `DOMContentLoaded` that's tripping it up. It needs to see that function as a container, not a single statement, for effective code analysis. I'm focusing on `_parse_to_hierarchy` and its function identification logic now.


**Dissecting the Pass Structure**

I've dissected the interaction between parsing passes. My focus is now the `arrow_function` found in Pass 1. While it's *found*, the core issue is Pass 1.5's handling of the `expression_statement` wrapping the `addEventListener` call. This pass seems to treat the entire block as a single unit, hindering proper hierarchical parsing. I'm scrutinizing how it distinguishes statements from container-like structures.


**Refining Pass 1.5 Behavior**

I'm refining the interaction between Passes 1 and 1.5. The anonymous arrow function is correctly *found* in Pass 1, and its descendants are tagged as "processed." But the `expression_statement` wrapping the `addEventListener` call itself isn't marked, causing Pass 1.5 to incorrectly classify the whole file as a single statement. I'm modifying the processing of these statement containers in Pass 1.5.


**Addressing Pass 1.5's Limitations**

I've pinpointed the core issue: Pass 1.5's overly broad treatment of the top-level `expression_statement` containing the `addEventListener` call. It's inappropriately classifying the entire file as a single statement. Now, I'm adjusting Pass 1.5 to avoid creating these large blocks that hinder subsequent pass's ability to dissect the code structure within. The goal is for each nested function, DOM element definition, and event listener to be correctly identified and represented.


**Unveiling the Hierarchy's Failure**

I've analyzed the final stages, and the hierarchy-building pass is where the problem surfaces. While the individual elements (functions, listeners, DOM elements) *are* identified, the `statement` block created by Pass 1.5 appears to be preventing proper parent-child assignments within `node_map`. This results in only the top-level statement being classified as a root element. I must correct how Pass 4 interprets the relationships to accurately reflect the nested structure.


**Addressing the Root Cause**

I've pinpointed the core issue: Pass 4, the hierarchy pass, is failing. While the relevant elements are identified (functions, event listeners, etc.), the giant "statement" block, created by Pass 1.5, is preventing proper parent-child assignment. This leads to only the top-level statement being classified as a root, which is incorrect, and results in the flawed parser output. I need to correct how Pass 4 interprets the relationships to accurately reflect the nested structure.


**Addressing the Hierarchy's Failure**

The parser *is* correctly identifying individual elements, including functions and listeners. However, my analysis reveals the core issue: Pass 1.5's creation of a large statement, encompassing the `addEventListener` call. This is preventing proper parent-child assignment. Consequently, the final output only lists one root element, the top-level statement block, masking the true, nested structure.


**Reframing the Output Logic**

I've shifted my focus to the output formatting. The parser's correctly building the hierarchy, with functions nested within the `DOMContentLoaded` listener. But, the final display logic *only* shows top-level elements. I need to revise the output traversal to display the children, unveiling the full structure as intended.


**Rethinking Output Display**

I'm shifting my focus to the output mechanism itself. The internal parser correctly builds a hierarchical structure, but the final presentation is limited. It only displays the top-level elements, hiding the detailed nested structure of functions and listeners. I need to modify the output's traversal to reveal the full parsed content.


**Re-Evaluating the Root Cause**

I've zeroed in on the source of the problem: Pass 4, the hierarchy builder, and the output routine. The identified elements are there, with the internal structure intact. But the final presentation only shows the top-level "statement," due to the handling of parent-child relations in the output. This is a critical flaw.


**Analyzing the Output Flaw**

I'm now tracing the parser's post-processing steps. While the hierarchy *is* built, my focus is now on the output's presentation, which only shows top-level statements. The issue lies in how the final output traverses the nested relationships within the parsed structure. The DOMContentLoaded wrapper's children are lost.


**Addressing the Hierarchy's Failure**

I'm examining the code structure built by the parser. My recent focus has been identifying the precise source of the output problem. The underlying hierarchy is being correctly constructed, with elements properly nested, but the final display is limited. The parser creates a single top-level 'statement' element, preventing proper output. I must now correct the output's handling of nested structures.


**Addressing the Parser's Flaw**

I've identified the key issue: the final output doesn't display the parser's properly-built hierarchy, specifically inside the `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper. The underlying code structure, where functions and listeners are nested, is correctly found, but the current traversal only shows top-level elements, obscuring the nested content. I need to correct the output to show the internal structure.


**Unveiling the Solution Strategy**

I've pinpointed the parser's misinterpretation. My goal now is to make the *children* of the anonymous arrow function, within the `DOMContentLoaded` listener, appear at the same level as the top-level elements. This, in essence, involves getting the parsing to "look past" that `addEventListener` call, and treat its internal structure as the true file content.


**Implementing the DOMContentLoaded Unwrapper**

I'm currently implementing the unwrap logic. By adding a pass that identifies the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener and sets its internal statement block as the root for parsing, the subsequent parsing steps should correctly identify and nest the code's components, directly addressing the root cause of the parsing flaw. This is the most direct approach.


**Adapting to New Logic**

I've integrated a new pass. It targets the `DOMContentLoaded` call, and if the wrapper is detected, the parsing scope is changed, effectively bypassing the initial statement block. I am testing and refining this logic.


**Integrating the Unwrapper**

I've implemented the DOMContentLoaded unwrapping. The parser now identifies the listener, and if it's the top-level construct, it pivots to parse from within the listener's callback body. This approach should effectively flatten the hierarchy, showing all inner functions and elements as direct children of the root, directly addressing the core parsing flaw.


**Implementing the Core Fix**

I've implemented a fix to correctly process `DOMContentLoaded` wrapped code. This pass identifies the wrapping `addEventListener` and, if detected, redefines the parsing scope to the listener's content. It avoids the restrictive `statement` block, ensuring correct hierarchical parsing and, critically, exposing the internal structure as desired.


**Targeting DOMContentLoaded Wrappers**

I've begun implementing a specific solution. The parser was misinterpreting files entirely wrapped in `DOMContentLoaded` listeners. Now, I'm adding a pre-processing step to detect and unwrap these listeners, effectively treating the listener's body as the code's root. This will expose all nested functions and listeners.


</details></think>

You've hit on a very important point, and your analysis is spot on. It's a classic case of a common best practice (wrapping frontend JavaScript in a `DOMContentLoaded` listener) creating an unexpected result for a parser that's looking at the code's structure.

You are absolutely right. My previous changes failed because the parser saw the *entire file* as one large element—the event listener—and didn't properly identify the rich collection of functions, definitions, and other listeners *inside* it.

To fix this, I'll implement the strategy you suggested. I will modify the parser to specifically look for this `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper. If it finds that the entire file is enclosed in this listener, it will intelligently "unwrap" it and treat the *content* of the listener as the main body of the script. This will allow it to correctly identify all the individual elements within your `app.js` file.

Here is the updated code for `parsers/js_parser.py`:

```python:parsers/js_parser.py
// ... existing code ...
    DOM_ELEMENT_QUERY = JS_LANGUAGE.query("""
    (call_expression
        function: (member_expression
// ... existing code ...
    ) @dom_call
    (#match? @method "^(getElementById|querySelector|querySelectorAll)$")
    (#eq? @obj "document")
    """)

    DOM_LOADED_WRAPPER_QUERY = JS_LANGUAGE.query("""
    (call_expression
      function: (member_expression
        object: (identifier) @obj
        property: (property_identifier) @prop
      )
      arguments: (arguments
        (string) @event
        .
        (arrow_function body: (statement_block) @body)
      )
    ) @wrapper
    (#eq? @obj "document")
    (#eq? @prop "addEventListener")
    (#match? @event "'DOMContentLoaded'|\"DOMContentLoaded\"|`DOMContentLoaded`")
    """)

else:
    # We no longer need a global parser instance.
// ... existing code ...
        query-based approach with tree-sitter.
        """
        try:
            tree = self._ts_parser.parse(bytes(source_code, "utf8"))
            original_root = tree.root_node
        except Exception as e:
            return [{"kind": "error", "name": f"Tree-sitter parsing error: {e}", "start_line": 1, "end_line": 1}]

        root_node = original_root

        # --- Pass 0: Unwrap DOMContentLoaded if present ---
        # If the whole file is wrapped, we treat the inside of the listener as the root.
        matches = DOM_LOADED_WRAPPER_QUERY.matches(original_root)
        if matches:
            # Get the node of the main @wrapper capture
            wrapper_node_list = [c[0] for c in matches[0][1] if c[1] == 'wrapper']
            if wrapper_node_list:
                wrapper_node = wrapper_node_list[0]
                # Heuristic: if wrapper covers > 80% of the file, unwrap it.
                if wrapper_node.end_byte - wrapper_node.start_byte > len(source_code.encode('utf8')) * 0.8:
                    for capture_node, capture_name in matches[0][1]:
                        if capture_name == 'body':
                            root_node = capture_node
                            break

        elements_by_node_id = {}

        def get_node_text(node):
// ... existing code ...
```

I've introduced a new "Pass 0" that runs before any other parsing. It uses a specific query to find the `DOMContentLoaded` listener. If this listener wraps most of the file, it intelligently sets the starting point for all other parsing passes to be *inside* that listener's callback function. This will now correctly expose all the nested functions, DOM element lookups, and other event listeners as top-level elements for the rest of the script to analyze.

Please run the test script again. You should see a much more detailed and accurate summary of the elements in `app.js`.

**Diagnosing Regex Mismatch**

I've identified the root cause of the `#match?` error: a mismatch between the captured text of the `@event` node, which includes quotes, and the regex. I need to modify the regex to correctly handle the quotes within the string literal captured by `@event`. I'm currently revising the regular expression to accommodate the quotes.


**Debugging Syntax Errors**

I'm focusing on the `Wrong number of arguments` error, which indicates a problem with my tree-sitter query syntax. I've double-checked the `#match?` predicate's usage, and everything seems correct. The regex itself should be fine. It appears that the issue might not be the content of the regex, but the way the regex itself is interpreted by the query engine. Currently, I am trying variations in regex quoting.


**Resolving Argument Issues**

I've re-examined the syntax of the `#match?` predicate in my `tree-sitter` query, focusing on the "Wrong number of arguments" error. The error is happening in the C library. I've reviewed the Python string literal's use for the regex and the regex's expected behavior. I'm now testing simplifying the regex, removing the need for special characters.


**Revisiting Predicate Syntax**

I've hit a wall trying to debug the `#match?` predicate. The error persists, and after reviewing the documentation, I still can't find a syntax error. Now, I'm considering how the regex is passed to the C library by the Python multiline string, and whether that could be the issue. I'm also going to look for online examples to see if I can find any useful comparisons.


**Reconsidering the Approach**

I'm rethinking my approach to solving the `#match?` error. Instead of complex regex, I'll extract the event argument in Python after querying. That avoids the regex complication in tree-sitter. The core problem is the C library rejecting the argument count, which this strategy should bypass completely.


**Switching Strategies**

I've decided to bypass the regex complexity and handle the string comparison in Python. I'll now query for all `addEventListener` calls and then filter the results. This removes the need for `#match?` and the associated argument errors. I'm optimistic that this simpler approach will work.


**Rethinking the Query Strategy**

I'm fully committed to shifting the string matching to Python and simplifying the tree-sitter query. By querying for all `addEventListener` calls and filtering in Python, I bypass the problematic `#match?` predicate. This approach is simpler, more robust, and avoids the error. I've started implementing the code modifications.


**Reworking the Implementation**

I've completed the code changes: removing the `#match?` predicate from my tree-sitter query and adding the filtering in Python. This moves string comparison to Python, simplifying the query, and avoiding the C library error. I'm now confident that the strategy will work.


**Implementing Python Filter**

I've now fully implemented the Python-based filtering, removing the `#match?` predicate, and querying for `addEventListener` calls, then filtering by the event type in Python. The new strategy bypasses the argument count error, and the code is ready to be tested.


**Eliminating the Match Predicate**

I've finished the core code modifications, successfully removing the `#match?` predicate and implementing the event filtering logic in Python. This simplifies the query by removing the problematic regex matching and the C library error. The code is now ready for testing.

You are right, another error. My apologies. That `RuntimeError` indicates a problem with the tree-sitter query itself, specifically with the `#match?` predicate. The syntax for regular expressions within these queries can be tricky and sometimes behaves unexpectedly.

I will fix this by simplifying the query to find all `document.addEventListener` calls and then filtering them in Python to find the specific one for `DOMContentLoaded`. This approach is more robust and avoids the complexities of the query engine's regex handling.

Here are the corrections for `parsers/js_parser.py`:

        func_query = JS_LANGUAGE.query("[(function_declaration) @func (function) @func (arrow_function) @func]")
        
// ... existing code ...
```

I've updated the `DOM_LOADED_WRAPPER_QUERY` to be less strict and moved the logic for checking the event name into Python, which is a safer and more reliable way to handle this. I've also defined the `get_node_text` helper function earlier so it can be used in this new pass.

This should resolve the error and correctly parse your `app.js` file.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing the Unpack Error**

I'm currently wrestling with a `ValueError: too many values to unpack`. It seems the `match[1]` data isn't formatted as expected – I was anticipating simple key-value pairs, but it looks like there are more elements involved. Now I need to inspect the `match[1]` contents more closely to understand their structure and determine the appropriate unpacking method.


**Diagnosing Unpacking Failures**

I've isolated the problematic line: `captures = {name: node for node, name in match[1]}`.  The error stems from an unexpected structure within `match[1]`.  My initial assumption of simple key-value pairs for unpacking was incorrect. I'm revisiting the `py-tree-sitter` documentation. It looks like a deeper inspection of the `Capture` objects' contents is crucial. I'll check the actual format of the captures now.


**Re-evaluating Match Structures**

I've had a breakthrough. It seems my assumptions about the `Capture` structure were off. The documentation suggests that while `query.captures()` might return tuples, `query.matches()` provides a list of tuples, where each element is indeed a `(Node, str)` pair within `match[1]`. I'm re-examining my previous successful code for clarity and comparing against the documentation more meticulously. The issue might not be the data's format, but a misunderstanding on my part.


**Troubleshooting the Unpacking Failure**

I'm still encountering the `ValueError: too many values to unpack`. It's clear that `match[1]` contains elements that are not consistently simple `(node, name)` pairs. I've re-examined the `py-tree-sitter` documentation and my past working code, which used manual indexing (`capture[0]`, `capture[1]`). This suggests the dictionary comprehension's unpacking (`node, name in match[1]`) might be the issue. I need to adapt my handling of captures to match their actual structure.


**Investigating Unexpected Data Structures**

I'm still receiving the `ValueError: too many values to unpack`, which suggests an item in `match[1]` has more than two elements. This is perplexing, as I expected a list of `(Node, str)` tuples based on the `tree-sitter` documentation and my past working code. I will re-examine the data and the code, to confirm if I understand the structures correctly.


**Rethinking Dictionary Creation**

I'm now circling back to the dictionary creation, feeling the issue lies there. The dictionary comprehension using unpacking seems to be failing. I am re-assessing if a simple loop with explicit indexing to access node and name is a better route to go, since I am very familiar with that working, as opposed to the more concise comprehension.


**Investigating the Match Structure**

I'm still battling the `ValueError: too many values to unpack`, and I've reached a standstill. Re-examining the code and the documentation, everything *should* work: the `match[1]` data *should* be a list of `(Node, str)` tuples. The problem is that something in that list is not. I am now considering re-writing the dictionary creation using indexing.


**Examining Capture Data**

I'm still struggling with the `ValueError`. I've decided to inspect `match[1]` directly by printing its contents. I'll then review those outputs to understand the data's actual structure. I am hoping to find some unusual values there.


**Revising Dictionary Construction**

I'm going to try using direct indexing to build the dictionary, rather than unpacking, to see if it sidesteps the error. My initial assumption was incorrect. I will switch to the explicit approach to see if that helps.


**Implementing a Safety Check**

I'm now adding a safety check to handle potential issues with the unpacking, by checking the length of the `capture_item`. This should ensure that any malformed data in `match[1]` doesn't break the code. I am working on making sure it works with older code as well.


**Adapting to Data Variations**

I've implemented a safety check to handle potential data structure inconsistencies. This ensures that each item in `match[1]` has the expected format before attempting to unpack it. This will help to ensure the code does not break.


**Adapting Dictionary Construction**

I've decided to stick with indexing instead of unpacking. This should allow me to handle any unexpected data structures within `match[1]`. It's less elegant, but, hopefully, less likely to break.


**Adapting Dictionary Construction**

I'm now adopting the safer `captures_dict[capture_tuple[1]] = capture_tuple[0]` method to build the dictionary, hoping to bypass the unpacking issue altogether. It's less concise, but it should work correctly.


**Analyzing Dictionary Creation**

I'm currently replacing the dictionary comprehension with indexing to build the `captures` dictionary. This aims to bypass the `ValueError` caused by unexpected data structures within `match[1]`. The idea is to use a more explicit approach to handle potential variations in the input.


**Analyzing Dictionary Comprehension**

I'm now aiming for a dictionary with keys being names and values being nodes. The previous unpacking approach with `node, name in match[1]` failed with a `ValueError`. My current focus involves crafting a more resilient solution by using direct indexing instead of the tuple unpacking.


**Adapting to Unexpected Structures**

I'm now swapping the dictionary comprehension for direct indexing in the loop: `captures_dict[capture_tuple[1]] = capture_tuple[0]`. This bypasses the unpacking issue. This change will be applied in both loops. The initial goal is to see if the change resolves the `ValueError`.


</details></think>

My apologies again for the series of errors. It's frustrating to be so close and still have the script fail.

The `ValueError: too many values to unpack` indicates that the data structure returned by the tree-sitter library is not what I expected in one specific case, and my code was not flexible enough to handle it. The way I was creating the dictionary of captured nodes was too strict.

I will correct this by using a more robust method of dictionary creation that doesn't rely on tuple unpacking in the loop, which will prevent this error. This is a small but critical change to make the code more resilient.

Here are the corrections for `parsers/js_parser.py`:

```python:parsers/js_parser.py
// ... existing code ...
        # Then, filter them in Python to find the specific 'DOMContentLoaded' listener
        dom_content_loaded_match = None
        for match in all_matches:
            # The previous dict comprehension was causing a ValueError.
            # This is a more robust way to create the dictionary using indexing.
            captures = {capture[1]: capture[0] for capture in match[1]}
            event_node = captures.get('event')
            if event_node:
                event_text = get_node_text(event_node)
// ... existing code ...
                    break

        if dom_content_loaded_match:
            # We need to re-create the captures dictionary for the selected match.
            captures = {capture[1]: capture[0] for capture in dom_content_loaded_match[1]}
            wrapper_node = captures.get('wrapper')
            body_node = captures.get('body')

            if wrapper_node and body_node:
// ... existing code ...
```

I've replaced the problematic dictionary comprehension in two places with a safer version that uses indexing. This should finally resolve the errors and allow the parser to run successfully.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Framing the Context Accurately

I'm currently outlining the parameters of the user's request, including all the nuances that were considered during this process. The goal is to create a clear handover document for a new assistant, and I'm including details about the steps taken so far. My aim is to anticipate potential errors and document any incorrect assumptions I've made.


**Identifying the Gaps**

I'm now focused on pinpointing the shortcomings of the existing parser. My analysis reveals it struggles with fundamental aspects required for workflow tracing. I am specifically looking to identify the missing elements in order to accurately trace the execution path from user interaction to backend processing. The objective is to fully prepare the new assistant.


**Documenting the Refinements**

I'm creating a comprehensive record of the user's directives, the actions I've taken, including the obstacles encountered, and any incorrect assumptions made. This documentation's primary aim is to facilitate an effective handover to a new AI assistant. My primary task is to modify `js_parser.py` to extract `dom_element_definition ` and `event_listener` and to accurately trace workflows from user interaction through to the back-end. The history of my work is documented for clarity.


**Revisiting the Failures**

I've addressed the earlier errors. The `TypeError` related to `tree-sitter` and the `SyntaxError` are fixed. Currently, the script runs without error but yields no output. My next step is to examine the updated JavaScript parser, ensuring it accurately identifies and extracts the `dom_element_definition` and `event_listener` elements. I have reviewed the `tree-sitter` queries. I suspect an error in their construction, or a misunderstanding of the matching process, prevents the anticipated information retrieval.


**Addressing the User's Requirements**

I've documented the user's precise request, including the goal to enhance `js_parser.py`. I've outlined the example workflow the parser should trace and the specific shortcomings it currently has. My initial attempts and subsequent failures are all recorded with the root causes documented. The information prepares for the next steps, including the `DOMContentLoaded` issue.


**Reviewing the Errors**

I'm now documenting the progression of my edits, focusing on the reasons for my failures. After fixing the initial errors, the parser produced no output. I traced this to a code structuring issue. The script now runs but still fails to extract specific details. My primary concern is the correct application of tree-sitter queries to find the DOM elements and event listeners within `app.js` and I'm now examining how best to extract them. The `DOMContentLoaded` issue is the main current challenge.


**Tracing the Workflow Steps**

I'm now providing a detailed outline of the user's request, outlining the workflow tracing task. The project includes the user's specific example, as well as the current failings of my code to isolate the elements needed. I'm going to provide the full history of my past attempts, including errors. The plan is to make the code more adaptable and accurate, to meet the needs of the user.


**Tracing the Root Issues**

I'm detailing the project's current status, including my failures in parsing JavaScript files where the code is nested within a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. The core issue is that the initial script identifies the entire file as a single statement, failing to go deeper. Attempts to correct this issue have failed due to incorrect use of the API and flawed query syntax.


**Reiterating the Goal**

I'm providing a detailed recap of the user's request, emphasizing the crucial need to correctly parse code encapsulated within a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. I've outlined the desired outcome of improved parsing, the desired workflow, and the key steps for an accurate trace. The project's root problems and my own failures are detailed.

Of course. I understand your frustration. The iterative process has been slow and plagued with errors. It's a good idea to get a fresh perspective. Here is a detailed summary of the task, the issues encountered, and the core of the problem, which you can share with another assistant.

***

### Task Description for AI Assistant

**Primary Goal:**
The primary objective is to enhance a Python-based JavaScript parser located at `parsers/js_parser.py`. This parser utilizes the `tree-sitter` library to analyze JavaScript code. The ultimate goal is to enable the parser to identify and extract the necessary code elements to visualize "workflows" within a web application. A workflow is defined as the chain of code execution that starts from a user interface event (e.g., a button click).

**Example Workflow to Trace:**
A specific example workflow has been identified in the user's project:
1.  A user clicks a button with the ID `parse-project-btn` in an HTML file.
2.  The corresponding JavaScript file, `static/app.js`, contains code to get a reference to this DOM element (e.g., `document.getElementById('parse-project-btn')`).
3.  An event listener is attached to this element (e.g., `addEventListener('click', parseProject)`).
4.  This event triggers a handler function (`parseProject`).
5.  The handler function makes a `fetch` call to a backend API endpoint (`/api/projects/parse`).

To successfully trace this, the parser must be able to distinctly identify `functions`, `DOM element definitions`, and `event listeners` as separate, structured elements.

**The Core Problem:**
The main challenge lies in parsing `static/app.js`. As is common practice, the entire script's logic is wrapped within a `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { ... })` listener.

The current parser fails because it identifies this top-level listener as a single, monolithic "statement" element that spans the entire file. It does not descend into the callback function of this listener to parse its contents. Consequently, none of the crucial elements inside it (functions, variable declarations, other event listeners) are being identified.

**History of Failed Attempts & Errors:**

My attempts to solve this problem have been unsuccessful and have resulted in a series of cascading errors, indicating fundamental issues with my approach.

1.  **Initial Implementation Errors:** My first attempt to add queries for DOM elements and event listeners failed with a `TypeError: 'tree_sitter.Node' object is not subscriptable`. This was due to a misunderstanding of the data structure returned by the `tree-sitter` `query.captures()` method.

2.  **Query Syntax & Logic Errors:** While attempting to implement a special case to handle the `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper, I introduced several more errors:
    *   A `RuntimeError: Wrong number of arguments to #match? ... predicate` occurred because of an incorrectly formatted regular expression within a `tree-sitter` query. The library's query-level regex engine is sensitive and was used incorrectly.
    *   A `ValueError: too many values to unpack` occurred when processing query results. The code was not robust enough to handle variations in the captured data structure returned by the library.

3.  **The Current Logical Flaw:** The latest version of the code attempts to solve the core problem by identifying the `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper and then reassigning a `root_node` variable to point to the *body* of the listener's callback function. The intention was for all subsequent parsing passes to operate within this new, narrower scope. **This logic has failed.** The parser still operates on the original, file-level root node, and its output remains a single "statement" element. The change in the `root_node` variable is not being respected by the subsequent queries and logic.

**In summary:** The task is to refactor the `_parse_to_hierarchy` method in `parsers/js_parser.py`. The refactored code must correctly handle the `DOMContentLoaded` wrapper pattern by effectively treating the content of the listener's callback as the main scope for parsing, allowing it to successfully identify and extract all nested functions, DOM element definitions, and event listeners within `static/app.js`.
